# Executive Summary

The act my system aims to aid is using open source software in an organization. The act of using open source software creates potential issues. First, is possible licenses that need to be adhered to. Not all open source software licenses are the same, and it is important that they are followed or the organization may face legal issues. The second issue open source software may cause an issue is the vulnerabilities that the software may have. It is important for an organziation to know and understand the vulnerabilities of the software they use. Though using open source software has its issues, it also has benefits, such as community based discovery and resolution of vulnerabilities and the costs saved by not paying to develop the software yourself.

My system works by having a developer create software and upload it to be evaluated for applicable vulnerabilites and licenses. Vulnerabilities are determined from the NIST Vulnerablitiy database. These results are then uploaded to a Vulnerability and License database and return to the developer. My system also allows for a manager to request vulnerability and license information from the Vulnerability and License database given specific software information. The manager can also create, change, and retrieve software policies to determine if a specific software meets policy by evaluting its vulnerability and license results.
